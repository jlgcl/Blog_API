* FRONTEND PLAN *

STATUS
    - create a routing for different pages: about page, home, posts, user page, unpublished posts (link from the user page)
        - create a Bootstrap navigation bar for these routes
            - create custom navbar design: different fonts, logo, bar design, etc.
            - make sticky navbar OR arrow to top of the page 
        - route for login page w/ form inputs
        - navbar "Log In" should change to "Sign Out" if a user is logged into session
    - contact form fields (contact info on the right side, fields on the left)
    Home:
        - current weather: Geolocation API?
        - scroll right to see more cards THEN link to the full category site
    

ERRORS/LEARNED
    - 'Home is not exported from ./routes/home' - don't need to destructure the import (i.e. import { Home }) since we are directly pointing at the object.
    - center Carousel images: mx-auto in className
    - React can't handle every CSS styles inline (i.e. margin-left) - use other methods.
    - review setting up fetch headers
    - to call a function in JSX, use: {this.renderFunction()} in render().

PLAN
    - for individual post thumbnail (in each post route), have summary input with character limit to show consistent thumbnail block size for all posts.
    - use compositions/specializations to incorporate components.
    - Nav pages should be routed through React router.
    - Use custom styling (media queries, colors, etc.) using a separate CSS file OR use styled-components.
    - no need for: lifting states, context, HOC.
    - need: forms/handling events, router, conditional rendering, etc.
    - mobile view

COMPLETED
    - main nav bar Bootstrap spacing
    - dark footer area
    Home:
        - create a carousel to show main headlines
        - create cards of featured/latest posts with only LIMITED summary view (read more...)
