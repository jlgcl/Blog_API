* FRONTEND PLAN *

STATUS
    - create a routing for different pages: about page, home, posts, user page, unpublished posts (link from the user page)
        - create a Bootstrap navigation bar for these routes
        - Posts should be a drop-downs with categories
        - route for login page w/ form inputs
    Home:
        - create a carousel to show main headlines
        - create cards of featured/latest posts with only LIMITED summary view (read more...)
    

ERRORS/LEARNED
    - 'Home is not exported from ./routes/home' - don't need to destructure the import (i.e. import { Home }) since we are directly pointing at the object.
    - center Carousel images: mx-auto in className
    - React can't handle every CSS styles inline (i.e. margin-left) - use other methods.

PLAN
    - use compositions/specializations to incorporate components.
    - Nav pages should be routed through React router.
    - Use custom styling (media queries, colors, etc.) using a separate CSS file OR use styled-components.
    - no need for: lifting states, context, HOC.
    - need: forms/handling events, router, etc.
